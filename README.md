#🔥 THERMAL TRAILS OF DEVASTATION: FOREST FIRE PATTERNS IN INDIA (2015-2024)
## 🌱 About This Project

This self-driven data storytelling project explores **forest fire alerts** across Indian states from **2015 to 2024**, built using a simulated dataset and visualized through **Power BI**.

Inspired by **NASA’s FIRMS platform** and **ISRO’s Earth observation materials**, this project offers a visual reflection on how seasonal fire alerts vary across geography and time — uncovering hidden patterns behind the flames.

## 🌍 Why I Chose This Topic

Forest fires are a rising concern in India, especially in **central and eastern belts**. While satellite missions track them scientifically, I wanted to **translate these insights into a visual language** I could create using the tools I currently know — Excel and Power BI.
This project was created to:
- Apply Power BI storytelling to meaningful environmental data
- Learn how fire alerts vary with geography and seasonality
- Explore real-world datasets like **NASA FIRMS** and **ISRO Bhuvan** conceptually
- Blend spatial, temporal, and ecological perspectives into one cohesive dashboard

Although raw FIRMS or ISRO fire alert datasets weren't used directly, the data here was **simulated using those structures and observable trends** over time — making this project conceptually valid and visually insightful.

## 📊 Dashboard Summary

This Power BI dashboard features:

- 📈 **Line Chart**: State-wise fire trends over 10 years 
- 🎗️ **Ribbon Chart**: Seasonal peaks across states 
- 🧮 **Matrix Table**: Alerts by month and year 
- 🔝 **KPI Cards**: 
   - Top Alert State 
   - Total Fire Alerts 
   - Peak Month 
   - Peak Year 
- 📊 **Bar Chart**: Comparing states across months 
- 🎯 **Slicers**: Year, State, Month for interactivity

---
## 🧠 Dashboard Highlights

- March and April emerge as the **peak fire months** in multiple regions.
- Central Indian states like **Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Madhya Pradesh** show persistent fire alerts. 
- Data reveals **seasonal fire behavior**, human–climate interaction, and possible ecological risks .
- These insights may reflect forest dryness, fire-prone belts, or shifting land use patterns.

Each visual was selected to let users not just **see data**, but **feel urgency** — behind every point is a patch of forest, a risked habitat, a pattern worth learning from.

---
## 📁 Files Included

- `India_Forest_Fire_Alerts_2015_2024.xlsx` – Simulated dataset (monthly state-wise fire alerts) 
- `ForestFire in INDIA.pbix` – Final Power BI Dashboard 
- `README.md` – Documentation file

---

## 📌 To be Noted:

- This dataset is **simulated** and structured using **patterns observed in open sources** like FIRMS and ISRO's dashboards.
- This project is purely **independent** and does not represent any institutional output.

## 💫 A Final Thought

I created this dashboard to better understand how **climate, ecology, and data** intersect — and to strengthen my storytelling skills in ways that feel personally meaningful.
